        <h1>Effective codeing Practice!</h1>

        <h3>29 November 2020</h3>

        <p > There are many different aspects of being productive. Your keyboard and pointing device position and
            comfort, your screen distance and posture in your chair, setting up your editor and knowing frequently used
            key shortcuts (jump between left/editors and tabs, opening and closing files, commenting out lines of code),
            your tools and tool chain (all in one IDE or jump back and forth to command line), access to debugging and
            performance tools, scripting anything that you do manually, continuous integration, committing small changes
            frequently so you always have a clean slate (don’t have to worry about trying new code and having to
            remember to undo it), write down or diagram complicated logic (if you don’t really understand the problem,
            it is difficult to code), get enough sleep, take breaks, don’t multitask too much, make sure you have some
            block of uninterrupted time, write your code in layers, building from simple, reusable functions to large
            applications. Keep each layer understandable and simple. Good luck!
